# node-timestamp
Simple node app that returns the current date/time/user timestamp from
`timestamp.txt`. This app exists to provide a mechanism to verify - after
`timestamp.txt` is updated via `updateTimestamp.js` or `update_timestamp.py` - 
that the returned value matches the expected value that a system test will set.
